        <h1>Type 1 & nutrition</h1>
        <br />
        <p class="first">
          Following a healthy diet is important for everyone – it is the key to
          maintaining a healthy weight, and reducing your risk of developing
          chronic diseases such as heart disease. A healthy diet for people with
          type 1 diabetes is the same as what is recommended for everyone. Our
          healthy eating video clip shows you how to build a healthy diet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For people with type 1 diabetes, diet and nutrition also play an
          important role in managing blood glucose levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main nutrients in our diet that give us energy are: carbohydrate,
          protein, and fat. Understanding how these nutrients and the foods they
          are in affect your blood glucose and your insulin needs will give you
          greater confidence when making food choices.
        </p>
        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p class="first">
          Carbohydrate is a vital source of energy for your body, especially the
          brain. When your body digests carbohydrate, it breaks it down into
          glucose, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. This causes your
          blood glucose levels to rise.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Carbohydrate is found in lots of different foods, and these foods also
          provide us with other important nutrients like fibre, vitamins and
          minerals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Which foods contain carbohydrate?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Breads, cereals and other grain foods like rice and pasta</li>
          <li>Starchy vegetables like potato, legumes, and corn</li>
          <li>Fruit</li>
          <li>Dairy foods like milk and yoghurt</li>
          <li>Sugary foods and drinks</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvdwjzjvf/image/upload/v1711191015/WhatsApp_Image_2024-03-23_at_4.14.52_PM_1_q73er5.jpg" alt="Diet Plan" id="imgg"/>
        <h3>Why are carbohydrates important?</h3>
        <br />
        <p class="first">
          The amount of carbohydrate that you eat in a meal has the biggest
          impact on your blood glucose level. Learning how to estimate how much
          carbohydrate there is in your meals is important to help you to decide
          how much insulin you need. Learn more about carbohydrate counting in
          the next tab.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Carbohydrates are broken down and absorbed into the bloodstream at
          different rates. The Glycaemic Index ranks foods according to how they
          affect blood glucose levels. Read more about the Glycaemic Index in
          the tab above.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Protein</h2>
        <p class="first">
          Protein is another source of energy in our diets and is the key
          nutrient that helps the body with growth and repair. Protein is broken
          down into amino acids in the gut so that they can be absorbed. Protein
          does not break down into glucose, so does not directly raise blood
          glucose levels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The main fats in the diet are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meats, chicken, fish & tofu</li>
          <li>Eggs</li>
          <li>Cheese</li>
          <li>Nuts & seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Milk and yoghurt are also protein foods. However because they also
          contain carbohydrate and will raise your blood glucose levels, we have
          listed them under the carbohydrate foods.
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr class="mid" />
      <div id="carbo">
        <h1>Carbohydrate counting</h1>
        <p class="first">
          Carbohydrate is found in many different foods and drinks. The amount
          of carbohydrate that you eat in a meal has the biggest impact on your
          blood glucose level after that meal. This is because all carbohydrate
          breaks down into glucose, which is then absorbed into your
          bloodstream.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Learning how much carbohydrate is in the food and drink that you eat
          will help you to work out your insulin doses, help you to be more
          flexible with what and when you eat, and help you to keep your blood
          glucose levels in target. If you use set doses of insulin, eating a
          consistent amount of carbohydrate will help to keep your blood glucose
          levels in target.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What foods contain carbohydrate?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Carbohydrate is found in many foods that we eat every day, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Breads, rolls, flat breads and wraps, crackers</li>
          <li>Breakfast cereals</li>
          <li>Grains, like rice, pasta, barley, couscous and quinoa</li>
          <li>Starchy vegetables like potato, legumes, and corn</li>
          <li>Fruit</li>
          <li>Dairy foods like milk and yoghurt</li>
          <li>
            Anything with added sugar (e.g. chocolate, confectionary, desserts,
            ice-cream, jam, syrups, sugary drinks)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Calculating how much carbohydrate is in your meals is called
          carbohydrate or ‘carb’ counting. Carb counting takes practice, and it
          can take time to learn these skills.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="font-weight: bold">
          The key steps to count the carbs in a food or meal are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Identify the foods in your meal or snack that contain carbohydrate
          </li>
          <li>
            Weigh, measure, or estimate the amount of the food that you are
            going to eat (your serve)
          </li>
          <li>Work out the amount of carbohydrate in your serve of the food</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <!-- <p>A simple way of calculating the carbs in your meal is to use carbohydrate exchanges.</p> -->
        <h2>Resources for carb counting</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="first">
          To work out the amount of carbohydrate in your meals and snacks, you
          need to look up their carbohydrate values. There are many useful
          resources to help you find out this information, including the NDSS
          carbohydrate counting factsheet or you can order carbohydrate counting
          resources developed by Diabetes Victoria's dietitians here.
        </p>
        <h3>Useful tips to remember:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            use the total carbohydrates value to count the carbohydrates (not
            the ‘sugars’ value). All carbohydrate breaks down into glucose, so
            you need to count the total carbohydrates.
          </li>
          <li>
            the amount of food that you want to eat may be more or less than the
            serving size on the label. If your serve is different to the serving
            size on the label, then you will need to use the information on the
            label to calculate the grams of carbohydrate in your serve.
          </li>
          <li>
            check whether the information on the label refers to the raw or
            cooked food – this will make a big difference to the carb count
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div id="gi">
        <h1>The Glycemic Index (GI)</h1>
        <p class="first">
          Not all carbohydrate foods will have the same impact on blood glucose
          levels (BGLs). Some carbohydrate foods are broken down and released
          into the blood stream very quickly and others are broken down much
          more slowly. The rate at which carbohydrate foods are released into
          the bloodstream is called the Glycemic Index (GI). Carbohydrate foods
          can be classified as having either a low, medium or high GI
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Low GI foods</h2>
        <p class="first">
          Low GI carbohydrate foods are digested slowly, releasing glucose into
          the bloodstream more gradually compared to higher GI foods. They are
          also a lot more filling because they sit in your stomach for a longer
          amount of time, before they are digested. This can help with weight
          management, as you will be less likely to overeat.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Examples of low GI foods include traditional rolled oats, dense
          wholegrain breads, lentils and legumes, sweet potato, milk, yoghurt,
          pasta and most types of fresh fruit.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Try to include at least 1 lower GI food at each of your meals.
          Remember that the portion size of carbohydrate is going to have the
          biggest impact on your BGLs. Just because a food has a lower GI
          doesn’t mean it can be eaten in large amounts.
        </p>
        <h2>High GI foods</h2>
        <p class="first">
          High GI foods are broken down and released into the blood stream
          quicker than other carbohydrate foods. They tend to cause a quick rise
          in blood glucose levels and often don’t fill you up as much as lower
          GI foods, so you may feel hungry a short time after eating them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Examples of high GI foods include white bread, highly processed/low
          fibre breakfast cereals, shorter-grain rice (e.g. Jasmine rice), soft
          drinks and confectionary, as well as many processed and packaged snack
          foods.
        </p>

          alt="GI index"
        />
        <p>
          The University of Sydney Glycemic Index website has more information
          about the glycemic index and the values of specific foods. You can
          also look for the Low GI symbol on packaging when shopping, however
          not all low GI foods will carry this symbol. To find out which
          products carry the low GI symbol, check out the website.

      <div id="coeliac">
        <h1>Coeliac disease and diabetes</h1>
        <p class="first">
          Coeliac disease is an immune condition that affects the small
          intestine. When people with coeliac disease eat gluten their immune
          system is triggered, causing inflammation that damages the lining of
          the small intestine. Left untreated, coeliac disease can lead to
          nutrient deficiencies, problems with the bones, joints and other
          organs, as well as having an impact on fertility.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          People with type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of coeliac disease
          – it affects up to 10 per cent of people with type 1 diabetes. Having
          type 2 diabetes does not increase your risk of developing coeliac
          disease. However, about 1 in every 70 Australians have coeliac
          disease, so people with type 2 diabetes can still be affected.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>symptoms</h2>
        <p>Symptoms can vary widely. Some of the most common are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diarrhoea and/or constipation</li>
          <li>Stomach bloating or pain</li>
          <li>Flatulence</li>
          <li>Weight loss</li>
          <li>Tiredness</li>
          <li>Anaemia</li>
          <li>
            In people with diabetes, unexplained fluctuations in blood glucose
            levels (BGLs)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some people have severe symptoms whilst others may have none at all.
          It is important to realise that the level of symptoms does not
          indicate severity of the disease – bowel damage can still occur in
          people who don’t experience any of these symptoms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Treatement</h2>
        <p class="first">
          The only treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten free diet.
          Following a gluten free diet allows the lining of the small intestine
          to recover, so it can properly absorb nutrients.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Gluten is a protein found in the grains wheat, rye, barley, oats and
          triticale. Processed foods can also contain gluten. Look out for
          ingredients like wheaten cornflour and barley malt extract in the
          ingredients list
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It can be challenging to eat a balanced gluten free diet whilst
          managing your BGLs and diabetes. Below are some tips.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Getting enough fiber</h2>
        <p class="first">
          Many gluten free grains are lower in fibre than those that contain
          gluten. Try these alternatives:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, legumes (e.g. baked beans,
            lentils, chick peas) and nuts – these foods are naturally gluten
            free and high in fibre.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use brown rice as it contains more fibre than white rice. Mix your
            rice with legumes or gluten free grains like quinoa to increase the
            fibre content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add extra fibre to your breakfast cereal or baked foods by adding
            psyllium husks or rice bran.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Carbohydrate counting and gluten free foods</h2>
        <p class="first">
          Getting diagnosed with coeliac disease can make carbohydrate counting
          more difficult, as it can mean a big change in the type of
          carbohydrate foods that you eat.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The amount of carbohydrate in gluten free foods is often different to
          their gluten-containing equivalent (e.g. rye bread and gluten free
          bread). Different brands of the same type of gluten free food may also
          contain varying amounts of carbohydrate.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Because of this, it is important not to rely on standard carbohydrate
          values. Check each food label to find out the amount of carbohydrate
          in the specific food type and brand you are eating.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Remember that many carbohydrate foods are naturally gluten free –
          starchy vegetables, many dairy foods, fruit, legumes and rice. You can
          continue counting these as you have done before. Read more about
          carbohydrate counting in the tab above, or read our factsheet.
