    <h1>Type 1 Diabetes Information</h1>

    <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are several types of diabetes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is Type 1 Diabetes?:</strong>Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025. 

            About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past few decades.</li>
        <li><strong>Causes:</strong>Type 1 diabetes is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, although the exact cause is not yet known.
            The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Usually, the body's own immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses — destroys the insulin-producing (islet) cells in the pancreas. Other possible causes include:Genetics
            Exposure to viruses and other environmental factors</li>
        <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> <li>Increased thirst</li>
        <li>Frequent urination</li>
        <li>Extreme hunger</li>
        <li>Unintended weight loss</li>
        <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
        <li>Irritability and mood changes</li>
        <li>Blurred vision</li></li>
        <li><strong>Other types:</strong> There are also other forms of diabetes, such as monogenic diabetes and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's important to manage diabetes through lifestyle changes, medication, and sometimes insulin therapy to prevent complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and nerve damage.</p>
    <p>If you suspect you have diabetes or have been diagnosed, it's crucial to work closely with your healthcare team to manage your condition effectively.</p>
